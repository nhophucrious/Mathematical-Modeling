# Mathematical-Modeling
This repo stores source code files (Python) to accommodate the MM assignment this semester. It is about Petri net, and while the general stuff is quite hard to program, we only worked on specially designed, tailored problems. Therefore, we used some math to solve the problem!

Update: this repo, along with the actual report, received a 9.5 over 10. Quite an achievement, eh? 🙏
